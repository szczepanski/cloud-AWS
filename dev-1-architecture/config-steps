Top layer architecture 

- Region - geographic
- VPC - private IP space 
- two availability zones - resilence
- 6 subnets - three per each availability zone

VPC - 3 Tier Architecture architecture:
- Private subnet
- Public subnet
- DMZ subnet

VPC components: 

- 2 Elastic load balancers - DMZ Subnet 
- 2 Application servers - public subnet 
- 2 database servers - private subnets

Client can only access ELB DMZ subnet. 

APP servers communicates only with ELB. 
Database servers communicate with App servers only

Security groups act as firewall - restricting access.
